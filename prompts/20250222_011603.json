  "prompt": "こんにちはを英語で何と言いますか？",
  "result": "😊\n\nこんにちは is typically translated to \"Hello\" or \"Good day\" in English. However, there are some nuances to consider:\n\n* こんにちは (konnichiwa) is a general greeting used during the daytime, so it's similar to \"Good morning\" or \"Good afternoon\" depending on the time of day.\n* If you want to be more precise, you could say \"Good day\" to convey a sense of time.\n* In informal settings, you could say \"Hi\" or \"Hey\" as a casual greeting.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n* Formal: \"Hello\" or \"Good day\"\n* Informal: \"Hi\" or \"Hey\"\n\nHope that helps! 😊",
