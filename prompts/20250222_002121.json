  "prompt": "こんにちはを英語で何と言いますか？",
  "result": "こんにちは！😊\n\n\"こんにちは\" in English is \"Hello\" or \"Good day\". However, if you want to be more precise, you can say \"Konnichiwa\" (コンヒチワ) as it is, since it's a Japanese greeting that doesn't have a direct translation.\n\nIf you want to express the same level of formality as \"こんにちは\" in English, you can say \"Good afternoon\" or \"Good morning\" depending on the time of day. But if you want a more casual greeting, you can simply say \"Hi\" or \"Hey\".",
