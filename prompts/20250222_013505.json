      "result": "こんにちは is \"Hello\" or \"Good day\" in English, depending on the time of day. However, a more literal translation would be \"Good afternoon\".\n\nIf you want to be more specific, here are some other ways to greet someone in English at different times of day:\n\n* morning: \"Good morning\" (おはようございます)\n* afternoon: \"Good afternoon\" (こんにちは)\n* evening: \"Good evening\" (こんばんは)\n* night: \"Good night\" (おやすみなさい)\n\nBut in casual settings, a simple \"Hi\" or \"Hello\" (こんにちは) is often used regardless of the time of day! 😊",
